Hi guys,
So it's not responsive and I struggled a bit handling with the Socket.io library.
That's what I managed to do in the given time.



Feedback regarding this exam is always welcomed.
What did you like? What didn't you like? What was missing?

The task was nice and comprehensive, it was fair and not too long.
I think that for next times if the task involves using a specific external library maybe adding references or more data about the library will assist the candidates.

Thank you for the opportunity :)
